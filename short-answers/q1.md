# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

A class is made for and instance to use. In order for an instance to be created, there needs to be a class. Class is the blueprint, instance is the actual creation.

It seems you may have misunderstood the question! How can we create class properties/methods, how about instance properties/methods? How are they both used and how are they different?
